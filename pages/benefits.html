        Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area has become synonomous with the tech industry. This is mainly because of the fact that it is home to countless prominent tech companies of the world
        as well as four of the five companies in FAANG (a popular term grouping the five most influential tech companies in the worldâ€”Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google). Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google employ hundreds
        of thousands of the most highly qualified engineers in the world, and as such has caused Silicon Valley to be one of the favorite landing spots for the brightest minds looking for high-paying STEM 
        jobs, especially right out of college. The high number of world class engineers also attracts educated and intelligent people from other disciplines as well as 57.1% of adult San Franciscans have a college
        degree compared to the 38% in the United States. The close proximity to these tech giants attracts people from all over the world and creates an atmosphere of productivity alongside building the local economy
        due to the importance of these companies to the rest of the world.

          The San Francisco Bay Area doesn't just have the tech giants that everybody around the globe knows of. They are also home to thousands of tech start-ups that dedicate themselves to pushing innovation to the next level.
          A large amount of these start-ups are located in the Business district of the city. Start-ups tend to be much smaller, but they have also created products that impact the lives of people all over the world. A few
          notable Silicon Valley start-ups include Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb. The success of such start-ups has also made the San Francisco Bay Area a hotspot for venture capitalists looking to invest their money into hot new companies, which
          in turn, causes more people who are interested in creating a start-up to move to Silicon Valley in order to seek funding alongside the culture that start-up businesses bring, and these steps are in a perpetuated cycle as
          they keep causing each other to happen. By bringing together hundreds of thousands of "self-starter" engineers, the start-up culture in Silicon Valley also provides a place for both aspiring and established engineers
          to network with and learn new technologies from each other. It fosters an environment of collaboration and brings a forward-thinking mindset to the table.

          The prominence of pushing technology forward in Silicon Valley has trickled into everyday life beyond the products created themselves. Progress in technology also brings the mindset for progress in culture, and because
          of this, Silicon Valley is one of the most politically progressive places in the United States, with heavy beliefs being placed into inclusivity and diversity. The Bay Area is a haven for those who believe they are
          not accepted for who they are, and is ranked as one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly cities in the world. Beyond this, ethnically, 34.4% of the population was born in a different country, and only 40.3% of citizens are solely
          caucasion. Over 15% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, and over 35% of the population is Asian, with about 5% of the population being African American, and the rest being of mixed ethnicity. Having such a variety
          of ethnicities and life-styles allows more viewpoints to be brought to the table and taken into consideration, which then goes on to improve upon the life of everybody.

          Roughly 66.4% of residents in San Francisco are considered "young adults" (between the ages of 18 and 65), which is a very high percentage. This is likely because of its propensity to attract technology enthusiasts which
          itself is still a relatively young industry. Because of this, it is developed as a city for younger people, meaning that there are thousands of different restaurants and attractions. The bay area is home to attractions such
          as the world-famous Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Stanford University, Union Square, and Lombard Street. The Bay Area also has a plethora of sports teams including the 49ers for football, the Warriors for basketball, the 
          Sharks for hockey, and the Giants and Athletics for baseball. In the amusement park department, Silicon Valley features the famous Six Flags: Discovery Kingdom as well as California's Great America from the Cedar Fair 
          amusement company. All of this along with exclusive access to some of the world's most advanced technology gives residents of the Bay Area plenty of recreational activites outside of their work.
