        Because Silicon Valley has been such a tech hotspot for the past few decades, it has been an optimal place for highly-educated and well-trained engineers to flock to for high paying jobs. However, this large number of
        people has caused the housing in the Bay Area to become very expensive. In fact, the median priced home in Silicon Valley costs $935,000 compared to the United States median of $226,800. This doesn't stop at houses either,
        as apartments have a sky-high average rental price of $3,631 per month which equates to $43,572 per year. Much of these price increases has come in the past few years, and many of the lower-wage citizens feel it, considering
        that homelessness in San Francisco increased by thirty percent in 2019 alone. The housing industry was also set back by way of mass foreclosure.
        During the great recession, multiple markets crashed including the stock market, but more specifically the housing market. In short, as a result of too much lending to what were considered “risky borrowers” for home mortgages,
        there were too many loans floating around unpaid, resulting in an uptick in housing prices across the country, eventually contributing to the crash. After the housing crash occurred, many people, whether they had the means before or not,
        could no longer continue paying off the mortgages on their homes. As a result, the banks lending the money were able to come and reclaim the homes and sell them, effectively pushing people out of their homes. 
        This particularly affected those living in the Bay Area as housing had become more expensive before the crash due to the previously mentioned increase in demand. Surrounding cities in Silicon Valley had some of the 
        highest foreclosure rates like Stockton, CA (first in the country) and Oakland, CA (tenth in the country). Because of all of this, unaffordable housing has been a major contributor as to why middle class families are leaving
        the Bay Area.

          Housing isn't the only thing in the Bay Area that many would consider to be unaffordable. Food costs are also higher in the Bay Area than anywhere else in the United States. For example,
          a gallon of milk can be upwards of four dollars by itself and the same is true for a dozen eggs. Silicon Valley is also densely populated because of the large number of people that live in a relatively small land area.
          Because of this, transportation can be extremely expensive for multiple reasons. These reasons include very expensive car insurance, which averages out to around $2,500 per year (as compared to the $1,500 per year average
          in the United States), high gasoline prices in California due to the tax of 47.3 cents per gallon (although this is becoming less of an issue because of the popularity of electric cars), and traffic that is ranked
          as the third worst in the United States. Finally, California's taxes tend to be much higher than other states, although this is offset for lower and middle class people from the benefits they recieve from these taxes
          such as subsidized healthcare. Overall though, the Bay Area is one of the most expensive places to live in the United States, and because its cost of living price tag continues to trend upward, it makes sense that 
          many lower and middle class families are trying to get out before it is too late.

          Many of the laws that are currently in effect in both California and in the Bay Area have had a negative effect on lower and middle class families and have been a key contributor to their migration
          away from the bay. One of the key offenders is proposition 13, a law that caps the property tax rates for larger residential and commercial buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area. This, along with the demand
          for more higher-end homes due to the influx of highly-paid engineers, has made it more economically viable for real estate companies to build more expensive housing and less affordable housing. This isn't an issue
          if you are making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, but for the regular families who may have already been struggling to make ends meet, the fact that a tax bill could make their housing less affordable
          makes things even harder and provides a compelling reason to leave. Another one of the key culprits in the housing shortage are the San Francisco zoning laws. Zoning laws are a type of regional law determining 
          where and what kind of buildings may be built. The zoning laws in the Bay Area dramatically limit the height of buildings (most are limited to 40 feet) and the number of residential units in each building (most are limited to three). Because of this, it simply isn't legal
          to build enough housing to fully meet the demand, and because there is a shortage, prices go up.
